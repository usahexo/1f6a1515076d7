#  76ers Finally Land Their Star Player in 3. 5 Trade

The 76ers have been in search for a superstar player for years. After years of tanking, they finally got their guy in the 3. 5 trade.

In the trade, the 76ers sent Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and Jerryd Bayless to the Suns in exchange for Devin Booker.

Booker is a 21-year-old shooting guard who is averaging 24.9 points per game this season. He is a scoring machine and will be a perfect fit next to Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.

This trade was a no-brainer for the 76ers. They were able to get their hands on a young superstar at the expense of three role players.

The 76ers are now one of the favorites to win the NBA title next year.

#  76ers' Future Looks Bright with Addition of 3. 5

The 76ers are coming off a successful season in which they made the playoffs for the first time since 2012. This was largely due to the emergence of young stars Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. The future looks bright for the team, as they have added another young star in 3. 5.

3. 5 is a 19-year-old point guard who was drafted by the 76ers with the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft. He played one season at Texas A&M, where he averaged 19.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.4 rebounds per game. He is a highly talented player who should be able to contribute immediately for the 76ers.

With Simmons, Embiid, and 3. 5 in the fold, the 76ers have one of the most talented young cores in the NBA. They should be able to make even more progress in the coming years and contend for championships.

#  Analysts:  5 Key to Turning Philly Around



Philadelphia 76ers are one team in the NBA that is on the rise. There are many reasons for this, but five key reasons stick out among the rest.

The first reason is the drafting of Ben Simmons. The LSU freshman was the first overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft and has already shown why he was so highly touted. He is averaging nearly 18 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists per game, making him a triple-double threat every time he steps on the court. His size and athleticism make him a matchup nightmare for opposing teams, and he is already one of the best players in the league.

The second reason for Philly's success is Joel Embiid. The third overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft missed his first two seasons due to injury, but has come back strong this year. He is averaging 20 points and eight rebounds per game, and looks like one of the future stars of the league. With Embiid and Simmons playing together, Philly has two players who can take over a game at any moment.

The third reason for Philly's success is their young nucleus of players. Players like Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and TJ McConnell have all played a big role in the 76ers' turnaround. All three of these players are 25 years old or younger, and they will only continue to get better as they gain more experience.

The fourth reason for Philly's success is their coach Brett Brown. Brown was hired before the 2013-2014 season, when Philly was coming off of a 10-win season. He has turned them into a playoff contender, despite having no All-Stars on his roster. Brown coaches his players hard and gets the most out of them by emphasizing teamwork rather than individual stats.

The fifth reason for Philly's success is their ownership group led by Joshua Harris. Harris bought the team in 2011 for $280 million, and he has shown that he is willing to spend money to put a winning product on the court. This offseason he traded for JJ Redick and Amir Johnson, two veteran players who have helped amp up Philadelphia's championship aspirations.

All of these factors have come together to help Philadelphia become one of the best teams in the NBA. They currently sit at sixth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 22-20, and they look poised to make a deep playoff run this year.

#  What 3. 5 Means for the Rest of the NBA

The Golden State Warriors are the new NBA champions. And as they hoisted the Larry O’Brien trophy, they set a new standard for what it means to be a champion. The Warriors finished the regular season with a record 73 wins and 9 losses, and then went 16-1 in the playoffs. That’s not just dominant; it’s historically dominant.

And so now the question is: how can other teams compete?

Some have argued that the Warriors’ success is due less to their own talent and more to the lack of talent on other teams. In fact, three of the best players in the NBA – Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green – all play for Golden State.

But while it’s true that Golden State has a lot of talent, other teams are starting to catch up. The Cleveland Cavaliers, for example, have LeBron James, who is arguably the best player in the world. And players like James Harden and Russell Westbrook are also putting up MVP-caliber numbers.

So how can other teams compete with Golden State? One answer is to try to build a team that is as talented as Golden State. But given the high price tags for top players, that may be difficult or impossible for some teams.

Another answer is to focus on defensive intensity. The Warriors may be able to score 100 points in a game, but they can also be scored on easily. If other teams can take advantage of this weakness, they may be able to slow down the Warriors and even beat them.

A third answer is simply to hope that Golden State falters. Teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and San Antonio Spurs have shown that they can beat the Warriors when they are playing well. So if those teams can maintain their level of play while Golden State slips up even a little bit, they may be able to come out on top.

In short, defeating Golden State will not be easy, but it is not impossible. Other teams will need to find ways to match Golden State’s firepower while also taking advantage of their weak spots. It won’t be easy, but it should make for some exciting basketball in seasons to come.

#  76ers Solidify Themselves as a Playoff Team with 3. 5

point Win Over New York

The Philadelphia 76ers were desperate for a win, and they got one on Tuesday night. Ben Simmons

and company completed a 3. 5 comeback to top the New York Knicks, 103. 5-100. This was a game

that the Sixers absolutely had to have, as they now sit in seventh place in the Eastern Conference,

just one game ahead of the ninth-place Miami Heat. With just 10 games remaining on their schedule,

the Sixers can’t afford any missteps if they want to make the playoffs for the first time since 2012.

Philadelphia got off to a hot start in this one, scoring 29 points in the first quarter. However, the

Knicks battled back and took a two-point lead into halftime. The third quarter was a back-andforth affair, with neither team able to take control of the game. It wasn’t until late in the fourth quarter that Philadelphia finally pulled away. A 3-pointer by JJ Redick gave them a five-point lead with just over two minutes remaining, and they never looked back. Simmons led all scorers with 24 points to go along with ten rebounds and eight assists. Redick added 22 points while Tobias Harris chipped in 20 points and seven rebounds. For New York, Kristaps Porzingis led the way with 32 points and 13 rebounds. Enes Kanter added 18 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. The Knicks have now lost six of their last seven games and find themselves three games out of playoff contention. With just ten games left on their schedule, time is running out for them to make a run at the postseason. Philadelphia will next be in action on Thursday night when they take on the Milwaukee Bucks
