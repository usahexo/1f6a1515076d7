#  How to make a perfect casino roulette B52

In a casino, the B52 is a variation of the casino roulette game. The objective of the game is to correctly predict where the ball will end up after it bounces around the wheel.

To make a perfect B52, you need to first understand how the game works. There are two main bets you can make in casino roulette: inside bets and outside bets. An inside bet is a bet that is placed on one of the numbered boxes on the roulette table layout. An outside bet is a bet that is placed on one of the coloured boxes or on one of the even-money propositions.

The most popular inside bet is called a straight up, which is a bet on a single number. Other popular inside bets include: split, street, corner and six line. A split is a bet on two adjacent numbers,while a street is a bet on three consecutive numbers. A corner is a bet on four adjoining numbers and a six line is a bet on six consecutive numbers.

The most popular outside bets are: red or black, odd or even, 1-18 or 19-36. The odds for these bets are always even money (1/1).

To make a B52, you need to place an inside bet on any five different numbers arranged in any pattern (e.g. 1-2-3-4-5 or 5-4-3-2-1). You can also place an outside bet on red or black, odd or even, 1-18 or 19-36 if you want to cover more numbers with your stake.

If your five chosen numbers come up as winners after all the balls have come to rest, then you will win 35 times your original stake! So, if you stake £10 then you will receive £350 back from the croupier!
