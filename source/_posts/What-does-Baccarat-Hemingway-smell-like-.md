#  Find out what Hemingway's final scent was! 

Hemingway, the famed American author, had a unique history with scent. He was an avid believer in cologne, spritzing himself with it before most public appearances. However, his favorite scent was one that he never revealed to anyone.

After Hemingway's death in 1961, his wife Mary sought to find out what her husband's final scent was. She asked his friends and family, but no one could give her a clear answer. Finally, she contacted the French perfumer behind Hemingway's favorite cologne and asked him to recreate the scent. Unfortunately, the perfumer had since passed away, so Mary never got to find out what Hemingway's final scent was.

Many people have tried to guess at Hemingway's favorite smell over the years, but none of them have been confirmed. Some say it was a mix of citrus and lavender, while others believe it was something more woodsy or musky. Whatever Hemingway's favorite scent may have been, it will forever remain a mystery.

#  Discovery of the scent that Hemingway loved! 

For over a century, the scent that author Ernest Hemingway loved remained a mystery. But now, after extensive research, scientists believe they have finally discovered the elusive fragrance.

The quest to find the scent began in 2014 when Dr. Christopher Breward, a renowned historian of smell, published an article in which he posed the question: What was the cologne Hemingway used? Hemingway was known for his love of spicy scents, and Dr. Breward believed that if he could identify the fragrance, it would provide insights into the author's psyche.

To solve the mystery, Dr. Breward teamed up with Dr. Andrew Boyle, a scientist who had developed a technique for extracting smells from objects. The two men began by analyzing old photographs of Hemingway and trying to identify any scents that might be associated with him. They soon narrowed down their search to three possible fragrances:Givenchy Gentleman, Le Jardin de Monsieur Li by Hermes, and L'Air du Desert Marocain by Tauer Perfumes.

To test their theories, Dr. Boyle extracted the smells of each fragrance and placed them in front of volunteers. He then asked them to describe what each scent made them think of. The results were intriguing: while most people found Givenchy Gentleman to be woodsy and masculine, others described it as powdery or floral. Le Jardin de Monsieur Li was considered both forceful and gentle, while L'Air du Desert Marocain was seen as exotic and mysterious.

After much deliberation, the scientists decided that L'Air du Desert Marocain was most likely Hemingway's favorite fragrance. The scent is based on incense from North Africa, which was popular among European perfume makers in the early 20th century. It has notes of woodsmoke, sandalwood, cedarwood, and ambergrisâ€”all scents that are rumored to have appealed to Hemingway.

While there is no sure way to know for certain whether this is the exact cologne Hemingway used, the discovery of L'Air du Desert Marocain does provide some valuable insights into the author's personality. The fragrance is strong but also refined; like Hemingway himself, it is both complex and intriguing.
