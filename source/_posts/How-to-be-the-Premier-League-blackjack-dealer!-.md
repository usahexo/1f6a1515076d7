#  How to win at Premier League blackjack dealer! 

Are you looking to win some money at Premier League blackjack dealer? Look no further, because this guide is going to teach you everything you need to know in order to become a winning player!

To start with, it’s important to understand the basic rules of the game. In Premier League blackjack dealer, players are given two cards each, and the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible. If your total goes over 21, you ‘bust’ and lose your bet. The dealer also has two cards, but one is face-down and the other is face-up. The aim of the game for the dealer is to get as close to 17 as possible.

The player can choose to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they’ve got). If they go over 21, they bust just like in regular blackjack. The ace can count as 1 or 11 depending on what will help the player the most - for example, if they have a hand of 6 and an ace, they can choose to count the ace as 11 so their total becomes 17 and they can stand rather than hit and risk going bust.

If both the player and dealer have blackjack (a hand consisting of an ace and a ten), then it’s a draw and neither player wins or loses. In addition, insurance bets are available - these are bets that are placed when the dealer’s upcard is an ace. If you think that the dealer will end up with a blackjack hand, then you can place an insurance bet which will payout 2:1 if this is correct.
