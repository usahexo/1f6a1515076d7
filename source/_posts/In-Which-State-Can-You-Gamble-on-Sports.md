#  In Which State Can You Gamble on Sports?

When it comes to gambling on sports, the United States is a bit of a patchwork of different laws and regulations. Depending on the state, you may or may not be able to place a bet on your favorite team. Here’s a look at where you can gamble on sports in America.

In most states, you can gamble on sports if you are over 21 years of age. However, there are a few states that have different age requirements, or where gambling is altogether prohibited. For example, in Nevada, you can place bets on sports at any age; in Delaware, the minimum age for betting is 18; and in Oregon, it is 21.

There are also a number of states where it is legal to bet on sports through licensed and regulated casinos, such as Nevada and New Jersey. However, there are other states where sports betting is illegal altogether. In these states, you will have to find an offshore bookmaker if you want to place a bet.

So, what are the states where you can gamble on sports? The answer depends on your definition of “gambling”. If we consider only those states where placing a legal bet on sports through a casino or other licensed establishment is allowed, then the list would include Nevada, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. If we also include states where gambling is legal but not limited to sports betting (such as poker or lottery), then the list would include 37 states in total.

However, if we consider all 50 states in America, then the list of states where you can gamble on sports would look something like this: Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware*, Oregon*, Montana*, Wyoming*, Colorado*, Iowa*, Indiana*, Illinois*, Missouri*, Kansas*, Oklahoma* and Texas*.

*These states have exceptions for specific forms of gambling – for example in Delaware and Oregon only parlay bets (where several teams are bet on as part of one wager) are allowed).

#  Sports Gambling Now Legal in Nevada

After a long battle in the courts, sports gambling is now legal in Nevada. This landmark decision opens up new opportunities for casinos and racetracks in the state, and is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue.

Supporters of sports gambling say that it will create jobs and boost the economy, while opponents argue that it will lead to addiction and corruption. Whatever the outcome, this decision is sure to have a major impact on the gaming industry in Nevada.

Sports gambling has been around for centuries, but it was always illegal in the United States. In May of this year, however, the Supreme Court struck down a law that had made sports betting illegal nationwide. This opened the door for states to legalize sports gambling within their borders.

Nevada was one of the first states to act on this ruling, and Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill into law making sports gambling legal in the state. The new law went into effect on October 1st, and casinos and racetracks are now able to offer betting on sporting events.

There are some restrictions on who can bet and how much they can bet, but overall the law is fairly liberal. Gamblers can place bets at casinos or online, and there are no limits on how much can be wagered.

The gaming industry in Nevada is already gearing up for a major surge in business. Casino operators are planning new sports books, and race tracks are expanding their betting facilities. There is also talk of developing mobile apps that allow gamblers to place bets from anywhere in the state.

The new law is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for Nevada casinos and racetracks. It will also create jobs for hundreds of people who will be needed to staff the new betting operations.

#  DelawareSports Betting Now Live

Delaware is the latest state to legalize sports betting, and the first state to offer full-scale sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban in May.

The Delaware Sports Betting website went live at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, offering single-game wagers on NFL, college football, NBA, NCAA basketball, MLB and NHL games. Bettors can also bet on horses and dogs at Delaware’s three racetracks.

“We are extremely excited to offer sports betting in the First State,” said Delaware Lottery Director Vernon Kirk in a statement. “This is another great product for us and we expect it to be very popular with our players.”

Sports betting is available online and through the Delaware Lottery mobile app. Bettors must be 21 years or older and physically located in Delaware to place a bet.

Delaware is one of seven states that have legalized sports betting since the SCOTUS decision in May. States now have the option to legalize sports betting under a 1992 federal law that allows them to do so if it is not prohibited by state law.

#  Is Your State Next to Legalize Sports Betting?

It seems that every day, a new state is legalizing sports betting. As of May 2019, ten states have already legalized some form of sports betting, with more likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.

What does this mean for those living in states that have yet to legalize sports betting? Is your state next? Or are you resigned to traveling to another state to place a bet?

To answer these questions, let’s take a look at what has happened so far.

Ten States Have Legalized Sports Betting

As mentioned above, as of May 2019, ten states have legalized some form of sports betting. These states are: Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Arkansas.

In most cases, these states have legalized sports betting in time for the start of the 2019 NFL season. For example, Nevada and New Jersey both had operational sportsbooks in time for the first games of the season.

It’s important to note that not all states have gone the full gamut in legalizing sports betting. For example, while Connecticut has legalized sports betting in general, it has not yet legalized online sports betting. And while Rhode Island has legalized online sports betting, it has not yet authorized land-based operations.

What Does This Mean for You?

So what does this all mean for those living in states that haven’t yet legalized sports betting? In short: it depends on your state’s laws and regulations surrounding gambling.

For example, if your state has legalized casino gambling but not online gambling or sports betting specifically, then you will be able to place bets at casinos but not online. The same is true if your state only allows brick-and-mortar establishments—you will need to go to a physical location to place a bet.

On the other hand, if your state has fully legalized online gambling and sports betting then you will be able to place bets from the comfort of your own home (or anywhere else with internet access). All you need is an account with a licensed operator and you’re good to go!
