#  How to Play Pitch Black Jack Like Brigitte Bardot

In honor of the release of " analyze " - her first album in over a decade - we're looking back at the actress turned singer's book-length tutorial on playing blackjack like a pro. Released in 2006, "How to Play Pitch Black Jack Like Brigitte Bardot" is a must-read for any fan of the game, delving deep into the math and psychology behind perfecting your blackjack strategy.

Bardot's tips are based on her own personal experience playing blackjack in Las Vegas and Monte Carlo over the years; as she points out, the key to winning at the game is to remember that it's not about luck alone. "Playing pitch black jack is all about making calculated decisions based on the cards you are dealt and the odds of drawing a card that will help you achieve your goal," she writes.

To start, Bardot recommends splitting your bets between two hands rather than betting everything on one hand. This way, you can minimize your losses if you happen to lose early in the game. She also advises players to keep track of how many decks are being used in order to calculate their chances of getting specific cards (e.g., an ace).

Perhaps most importantly, though, Bardot stresses the importance of staying calm and focused while playing; as she puts it, "poker face is key." In other words, don't let your emotions get the best of you - even if you're down to your last chip, don't give up! Just because you've lost a few rounds doesn't mean you can't win the next one.

With these tips in mind, you're ready to take on the tables like Brigitte Bardot herself. So roll up those sleeves, put on some lipstick, and get ready for some serious casino action!

#  How to Play 'Pitch Black Jack' Like Brigitte Bardot

There's nothing quite like a game of Pitch Black Jack to get the heart racing. If you're looking to add a bit of excitement to your next party, or just want to know how to play like Bardot, read on!

The basic rules of the game are simple: each player is dealt two cards, and the player with the highest combined value of their cards must take all the cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible - but be careful not to go over, or you'll have to take another card! Ace is worth 1 point, 2-10 are worth face value, and a Jack (J) or Queen (Q) are both worth 10 points.

Once everyone has been dealt their cards, the player with the highest card begins by either taking all the cards on the table, or picking up one more card. If they take all the cards, then it's their turn again and play passes clockwise around the table. If they pick up another card, then play passes to the left and that person can either take all the cards on offer or pick up one more. The aim is to avoid having to take any more cards - if you do, then you must put them back in the deck and shuffle it before playing on.

The game continues until one player has won all the cards. The winner is whoever has 21 or less points - if you go over 21 then you automatically lose!

Now that you know how to play, let's take a look at some tips for becoming a Pitch Black Jack pro!

- Firstly, always try and work out what your opponent's highest card is. This will give you an idea of what you need in order to beat them.

- Keep track of what cards have been played - this will help when it comes time for you to make your move.

- Beware of taking too many risks - going over 21 can easily cost you the game!

- Try and stay calm under pressure - this can be key when it comes down to winning or losing a hand.

#  Learn How to Play with Brigitte Bardot's Style of Pitch Black Jack

The following is a guide on how to play the game of blackjack in Brigitte Bardot's signature style. This consists of betting low and maintaining a cool, calm demeanor even when things are not going in your favor.

To get started, select a table that has a minimum bet of $5. Sit down and place your bet by placing chips in the betting circle. If you lose your hand, double your bet for the next hand. If you win, collect your chips and move on to the next hand.

The basic principle of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. In Bardot's style, you want to keep your bets low so that you can stay in the game longer. For most hands, bet one or two chips. When you have a strong hand, increase your bet to three or four chips. If the dealer goes over 21, he busts and you automatically win regardless of what happens with your hand.

If the dealer has an Ace up, he will offer you insurance. This is where you can make money by betting against him. If he has a blackjack (an Ace and a ten), he will win automatically unless you also have a blackjack. In this case, it is called a push and both players keep their bets. If the dealer does not have blackjack, you lose your insurance bet but still have a chance to win the hand.

When playing blackjack in Bardot's style, always be aware of what cards are left in the deck so that you can make smart decisions about when to hit or stand. Stay calm and collected even when things are going against you, and soon enough you'll be raking in the wins!
