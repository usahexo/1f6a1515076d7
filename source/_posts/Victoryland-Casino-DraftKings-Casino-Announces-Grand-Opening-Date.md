#  Victoryland Casino DraftKings Casino Announces Grand Opening Date

On Friday, September 22, 2017, Victoryland Casino in Shorter, Alabama will open its doors to the public as a DraftKings Casino. The casino is owned and operated by TRONc Inc., a subsidiary of great gaming company TRONc Holdings Inc. (TSX-V:TORN)

This is big news for the state of Alabama and for the citizens of Montgomery County who have been without a casino since December 2014 when the corrupt Wiregrass Country Club closed its doors. Victoryland is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs and bring in over $5 million in annual tax revenue to the state.

Victoryland has undergone a significant renovation in preparation for its grand opening as a DraftKings Casino. The casino floor has been rebuilt and now includes a mix of electronic games and traditional table games such as blackjack, craps, and roulette. There are also several restaurants on site, including a buffet, pizza place, and steakhouse.

Players will be able to use their existing DraftKings accounts to play at Victoryland Casino. In addition, the casino will offer some exclusive promotions for DraftKings players, including free hotel stays and complimentary food and beverages.

"We're excited to open our doors and welcome players from all over the state," said TRONc CEO John Knoll. "Victoryland offers something for everyone, with both electronic games and traditional table games."

The opening of Victoryland Casino is great news for Alabama residents who are looking for a fun place to gamble. With 1,000 new jobs created and millions in tax revenue generated annually, Victoryland is sure to be a success.

#  VictoryLand Casino & Resort To Open New $245 Million Gaming Facility

VictoryLand casino is set to open a new $245 million gaming facility. The new complex will be the largest in Alabama, and is expected to create 1,000 jobs. VictoryLand is also planning to invest $15 million in the local community.

“This new casino resort is a game changer for VictoryLand and for Alabama,” said Milton McGregor, owner of VictoryLand. “It will create jobs and provide much-needed new tax revenue for the state. In addition, we are investing $15 million in our local community, which will benefit businesses and families throughout the region.”

The new casino resort will include a 150,000-square-foot gaming floor with 2,500 slot machines and 130 table games. There will also be a hotel with 250 rooms, a spa, a fitness center, and numerous restaurants and entertainment options.

VictoryLand has been closed since 2013 following a series of raids by state authorities. However, the casino has recently reopened after filing a federal lawsuit against the state of Alabama.

#  VictoryLand Casino to Open Doors in September

The long-awaited VictoryLand casino is set to open its doors in September, just in time for the holiday season. This $245 million facility will offer 1,500 gaming devices and 50 table games, as well as a variety of restaurants and retail shops.

Governor Kay Ivey made the announcement on Tuesday, praising the new development as a boon for the local economy. "VictoryLand will create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in new revenue for the state," she said.

VictoryLand was forced to close its doors in 2013 after being raided by state troopers. But earlier this year, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the casino could reopen, pending the outcome of a federal lawsuit over electronic bingo machines.

According to VictoryLand CEO Milton McGregor, the casino will be hiring 300 people in advance of its September opening. "We are looking for experienced dealers, slot technicians, marketing experts and many more," he said.

The opening of VictoryLand is sure to be good news for local businesses, many of which have suffered since the casino was shut down five years ago. "It's going to help us all out," said Vicki Barber, owner of a hair salon near VictoryLand. "I'm so excited."

There is no word yet on when construction will begin on the casino's hotel tower, but officials say it is still scheduled to open in 2019.

Governor Kay Ivey announced Thursday that VictoryLand casino is expected to open by September 1.

The Alabama casino has been closed since 2013, when it was raided by state troopers and then-Governor Robert Bentley.

Ivey says the gaming center will employ about 1,000 people. The governor said the facility will also offer a high-end hotel, restaurants and a conference center.

Alabama's VictoryLand casino is on track to reopen in September with "hundreds of new jobs", Governor Kay Ivey announced Thursday." 
"The gaming center has been closed since 2013, when it was raided by state troopers and then-Governor Robert Bentley," Reuters reports. 
"Ivey says the gaming center will employ about 1,000 people." 
Aside from poker and blackjack tables, the casino will also offer a high-end hotel, restaurants and a conference center according to Ivey. 

VictoryLand was founded in 1983 by Milton McGregor and at its height employed over 2,500 people. The closure of the casino cost the state around 1,500 jobs.

The VictoryLand casino is set to reopen on September 1, after more than five years of being closed. The casino, which is located in Macon County, Alabama, was shut down in February 2013 due to illegal gambling allegations.

Owner Milton McGregor was indicted on federal charges, along with several other individuals, including legislators and state regulators. The charges included conspiracy, bribery, and money laundering.

However, the casino is now ready to reopen, following a settlement reached earlier this year between McGregor and the state of Alabama. As part of the agreement, VictoryLand agreed to pay a $2 million fine, as well as renovate the property and implement new security measures.

In addition to the casino, the property will also include a hotel and concert venue. Governor Kay Ivey is scheduled to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the reopening later this month.
