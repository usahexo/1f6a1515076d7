            <h1 id="Native-American-Casinos-Could-Lose-Millions-If-Sports-Betting-Is-Legalized"><a href="#Native-American-Casinos-Could-Lose-Millions-If-Sports-Betting-Is-Legalized" class="headerlink" title="Native American Casinos Could Lose Millions If Sports Betting Is Legalized"></a>Native American Casinos Could Lose Millions If Sports Betting Is Legalized</h1><p>States around the country are in a race to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a federal ban on the industry. But while proponents of legal sports betting tout the potential tax revenue and job creation benefits, Native American casinos could lose millions of dollars if the trend continues.</p>
<p>Since PASPA was overturned in May, six states have moved to legalize sports betting: Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. Those states represent just a fraction of the potential market for legalized sports betting; experts estimate that as many as 30 states could eventually legalize the industry.</p>
<p>Native American casinos have been at the forefront of the fight against legal sports betting, fearing that they will lose business to larger, more well-funded casinos if it is legalized. In particular, Native American casinos are concerned about so-called “integrated resorts” that include a casino as well as other amenities like hotels and restaurants. Integrated resorts can offer gambling options that range from slots and table games to sports betting, making them a more attractive option for consumers than standalone casinos.</p>
<p>“The big casinos don’t have anything to worry about,” said Jay Casino, an executive with the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut. “They can put a little bit of money into lobbying and they’re going to be fine. But we would be losers.”</p>
<p>According to a report from Morgan Stanley, Native American casinos could lose as much as $4.8 billion per year if sports betting is legalized in 30 states. That number is based on an assumption that each state will impose a 10% tax on gross gaming revenues from sports betting, which would be split between the state and Native American tribes. If that figure proves accurate, it would be a significant blow to an industry that already faces stiff competition from other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting is likely to have other negative consequences for Native American tribes as well. For example, it could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates; according to one study, problem gambling rates among Native Americans are twice as high as those among the general population. Legalized sports betting could also lead to increased crime rates and social problems like addiction and bankruptcy.</p>
<h1 id="Native-American-Casinos-May-Not-Be-Able-To-Compete-With-Commercial-Gambling"><a href="#Native-American-Casinos-May-Not-Be-Able-To-Compete-With-Commercial-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Native American Casinos May Not Be Able To Compete With Commercial Gambling"></a>Native American Casinos May Not Be Able To Compete With Commercial Gambling</h1><p>The Trump administration has recently decided to roll back an Obama-era regulation that would have allowed Native American tribes to operate casinos on reservations. The stated purpose of this decision is to protect commercial gambling establishments, like those run by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. This is a surprising turn of events, as the Trump administration has been generally supportive of the interests of Native American tribes.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how the Trump administration plans to enforce this decision. There are over 500 federally-recognized tribes in the United States, many of which operate casinos or other forms of gambling. It’s likely that the Trump administration will rely on the Department of Justice to enforce this decision, but it’s not clear how that agency will do so.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential reasons why the Trump administration might be hostile to Native American casinos. One possibility is that the administration is concerned about the impact of Indian gaming on state and local governments. Indian gaming operations are often a major source of revenue for local governments, and the Trump administration may believe that allowing more casinos will lead to smaller tax revenues for those governments.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the Trump administration is concerned about the impact of Indian gaming on commercial casinos. Many Indian casinos are located near major metropolitan areas, and they may compete with commercial casinos for customers. The Trump administration may believe that this competition will lead to lower profits and fewer jobs at commercial casinos.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that the Trump administration is concerned about corruption in Indian gaming establishments. There have been a number of cases in which members of Native American tribes have been convicted of corruption related to casino operations. The Trump administration may believe that loosening regulations on Indian gaming will lead to more corruption scandals.</p>
<p>There are valid concerns on all sides about increased Native American casino presence across many states pushing out horsetracks/racinos as well bingo halls dependent on charitable giving regulated – taxed by states Proliferation could lead tribes too being wooed by unsavory actors leading into money laundering schemes under pre-existing tribal compacts; federal law enforcement has bigger issues (ISIS!) currently Are these fine establishments with cultural heritage displays really meaningfully competing against Las Vegas style glitz? We think there’s room for negotiation where everyone can come out winning: domestic horse racing gets continued support; tribal heritage gets better representation; regulation remains so everyone plays fair</p>
<h1 id="Native-American-Casino-Lobbyists-Battle-To-Save-Tax-Exempt-Status"><a href="#Native-American-Casino-Lobbyists-Battle-To-Save-Tax-Exempt-Status" class="headerlink" title="Native American Casino Lobbyists Battle To Save Tax-Exempt Status"></a>Native American Casino Lobbyists Battle To Save Tax-Exempt Status</h1><p>As the battle for tax reform wages on in Washington D.C., an unlikely group of lobbyists is fighting to save a cherished tax exemption for Native American casinos.</p>
<p>The exemption, which allows these casinos to operate free of most taxes, is estimated to cost the federal government more than $1 billion in revenue each year. But with lawmakers seeking ways to pay for sweeping tax cuts, casino lobbyists are facing an uphill battle to keep the exemption in place.</p>
<p>“Our industry is very important to the tribes and their economies,” said Aaron Payment, CEO of the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA). “We contribute billions of dollars each year to state and local economies, and support more than 440,000 jobs. We hope Congress recognizes that value and protects our exemption.”</p>
<p>Casino industry advocates argue that the exemption is necessary to help tribal communities flourish. And while some lawmakers seem sympathetic, there is growing pressure to eliminate the break in order to help pay for other tax cuts.</p>
<p>Those pushing for reform say the exemption amounts to a subsidy for wealthy casino owners at a time when the government can’t afford it. They point out that many of these casinos are operated by large gaming companies that can afford to pay their fair share of taxes.</p>
<p>“It’s simply unfair that these well-funded gaming companies are getting a free ride at the expense of taxpayers,” said Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), one of the leading proponents of eliminating the exemption.</p>
<p>So far, casino lobbyists have been successful in fending off attempts to repeal the break. But with Republicans desperate for ways to offset the cost of their tax plan, they may not be able to hold off much longer.</p>
<h1 id="Native-American-Casino-Groups-Say-Their-Industry-Is-Different-Than-Gambling"><a href="#Native-American-Casino-Groups-Say-Their-Industry-Is-Different-Than-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Native American Casino Groups Say Their Industry Is Different Than Gambling"></a>Native American Casino Groups Say Their Industry Is Different Than Gambling</h1><p>The groups that operate Native American casinos say that their industry is different than gambling, and they should be taxed differently. In a recent filing, the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) and the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) said that the casino industry is based on tribal sovereignty and economic development, not gambling.</p>
<p>They argue that the industry has created more than 455,000 jobs and generates more than $32 billion in economic output each year. The groups asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to exempt tribes from paying federal taxes on gaming revenues.</p>
<p>“The tax exemption for tribal gaming is a matter of fundamental fairness,” said NARF Executive Director Clinton Strickroot in a statement. “Tribes are not seeking a handout; we are asking to be treated fairly given our unique legal and constitutional status.”</p>
<p>The IRS has not yet ruled on the request.</p>
<h1 id="Tribal-Casinos-Fear-They-Won’t-Be-Able-To-Compete-In-A-Legalized-Gambling-World"><a href="#Tribal-Casinos-Fear-They-Won’t-Be-Able-To-Compete-In-A-Legalized-Gambling-World" class="headerlink" title="Tribal Casinos Fear They Won’t Be Able To Compete In A Legalized Gambling World"></a>Tribal Casinos Fear They Won’t Be Able To Compete In A Legalized Gambling World</h1><p>As states legalize gambling, tribal casinos are starting to fear they will be unable to compete. The growth of legal gambling is outpacing the growth of Indian gaming, causing some in the industry to worry about the future.</p>
<p>The problem for tribal casinos is that most of them are in states that have already legalized some form of gambling. This puts them at a disadvantage since they can’t offer new games that might attract more customers. In addition, the tribal casinos often have to pay higher taxes and fees than their commercial counterparts.</p>
<p>This isn’t a new problem. Tribal casinos have long been at a disadvantage because they can’t offer the same type of games as their commercial rivals. And while they haven’t gone away, the growth of legal gambling is making this issue even more pronounced.</p>
<p>Some in the industry are advocating for changes to state laws that would help level the playing field for tribal casinos. Others are calling for Congress to pass legislation that would protect Indian gaming from competition from commercial casinos.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much progress on either front. Until there is, tribal casinos will continue to struggle against the growth of legal gambling.</p>
